## 1. Introduction

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. CSS allows you to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other design elements of web pages. This documentation will guide you through the fundamentals of CSS and how to use it effectively.

## 2. Getting Started

### Including CSS in HTML

You can include CSS in an HTML document in three ways:

#### Inline CSS
```html
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">This is a blue text.</p>
```

#### Internal CSS (In the `<head>` section)
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <style>
        p {
            color: blue;
            font-size: 16px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <p>This is a blue text.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

#### External CSS (Link to an external stylesheet)
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <p>This is a blue text.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## 3. Selectors

Selectors are used to target HTML elements for styling. There are several types of selectors:

### Element Selectors

Select elements by their HTML tag name.
```css
p {
    color: blue;
}
```

### Class Selectors

Select elements by their class attribute.
```css
.button {
    background-color: #3498db;
    color: #fff;
}
```

### ID Selectors

Select a single element by its unique ID.
```css
#header {
    font-size: 24px;
}
```

## 4. Properties and Values

CSS properties are used to define the style of selected elements, and values specify how those properties should be applied.

Example:
```css
p {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 16px;
}
```

## 5. CSS Comments

Comments in CSS start with `/*` and end with `*/`. They are used for documentation or to temporarily disable code.

```css
/* This is a CSS comment */
```

## 6. Inheritance and Specificity

CSS properties can be inherited from parent elements, but specific rules may override inheritance. Specificity is a way to determine which rule takes precedence when multiple rules conflict.

## 7. Box Model

The box model describes how elements are rendered on the web page and consists of content, padding, border, and margin.

### Margin

Space outside the border.

### Padding

Space between the content and the border.

### Border

The element's border.

## 8. Layout

CSS provides various ways to control the layout of elements.

### Display

- `block`: Elements take up full width, stack vertically.
- `inline`: Elements flow horizontally, only take up as much width as necessary.
- `inline-block`: Combines features of both `block` and `inline`.

### Position

- `static`: Default position.
- `relative`: Positioned relative to its normal position.
- `absolute`: Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
- `fixed`: Positioned relative to the viewport.

### Float

Allows elements to be pushed to the left or right and text to wrap around them.

### Flexbox

A one-dimensional layout system for distributing space along a single axis.

### Grid

A two-dimensional layout system that divides the space into rows and columns.

## 9. Typography

CSS offers numerous properties to control typography, including `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `line-height`, and more.

## 10. Colors

You can specify colors using keywords, hexadecimal values, RGB values, or HSL values.

Example:
```css
p {
    color: #FF5733;
    background-color: rgba(0, 128, 255, 0.5);
}
```

## 11. Backgrounds

Use CSS properties like `background-color`, `background-image`, and `background-size` to style backgrounds.

## 12. Transitions and Animations

CSS allows you to create smooth transitions and animations using properties like `transition` and `keyframes`.

## 13. Media Queries

Media queries let you apply different styles based on the screen size or device characteristics. They are crucial for responsive web design.

Example:
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    /* Styles for screens smaller than 768px */
}
```

## 14. Conclusion

This documentation provides a fundamental understanding of CSS. To become proficient, practice and explore CSS further, experimenting with various properties and selectors to create visually appealing web designs. Remember to keep your code organized and maintainable for larger projects. CSS is a powerful tool for web development, and with practice, you can create beautiful and responsive websites.
